// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// A RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If any goroutine calls [RWMutex.Lock] while the lock is already held by
// one or more readers, concurrent calls to [RWMutex.RLock] will block until
// the writer has acquired (and released) the lock, to ensure that
// the lock eventually becomes available to the writer.

// Note that this prohibits recursive read-locking.

// !!!!!
// A [RWMutex.RLock] cannot be upgraded into a [RWMutex.Lock],
// nor can a [RWMutex.Lock] be downgraded into a [RWMutex.RLock].

// In the terminology of [the Go memory model],
// the n'th call to [RWMutex.Unlock] “synchronizes before” the m'th call to Lock
// for any n < m, just as for [Mutex].

// For any call to RLock, there exists an n such that
// the n'th call to Unlock “synchronizes before” that call to RLock,
// and the corresponding call to [RWMutex.RUnlock] “synchronizes before”
// the n+1'th call to Lock.
